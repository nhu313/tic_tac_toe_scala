#Overview#
This is console Tic Tac Toe game, written in Scala. See [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) for more information on the game. 

I used the sbt (Simple Build Tool) to run the application. To install sbt
    brew install sbt
or follow [sbt installation guide](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Setup.html).

The source files are in src/main/scala/tictactoe. App.scala is the entry point to the application.


#RunTesting#
    sbt test
The test files are in test/main/scala/tictactoe.
